 <p>   [Verse 1]
<br>Your word and my word and your word is
<br>Tomorrow, today and yesterday
<br>But it's a necessary evil
<br>And you will find your way there
<br>Your feelings and mine are all holy and
<br>You give me an inner sanctity
<br>You feel the same way that I do for you, about her
<br>Your word and my word and her word is
<br>Yesterday, today and tomorrow
<br>And twilight gives me an inner sanctity
</p>
<p>
    <br>[Chorus 1]
    <br>And you're feeling
    <br>And you're hungry for her
    <br>And you don't understand it
    <br>But you know you haven't planned it
</p>
<p>
    <br>[Verse 2]
    <br>Your feelings and mine are all lonely
    <br>And dawn comes, you're there lying with me
    <br>And you reach out to touch me
    <br>But I am in the twilight
    <br>Your feelings and mine are all holy but
    <br>You know, and I know it's untrue because
    <br>When day dawns, you're there lying with me
    <br>And the dawn can fly away
</p>
<p>
    <br>   [Chorus 2]
    <br>And you know I love you, but you know that
    <br>There's nothing you can do about it
    <br>Because you love her
    <br>And you still love me
</p>
<p>
    <br>[Bridge]
    <br>If I could be her...
    <br>But I'm not her and she's not me
    <br>And you're somewhere different
    <br>On a different planet
</p>
<p>
    <br>[Chorus 3]
    <br>And you still want it
    <br>The inner sanctity
    <br>And it's an evil
    <br>But the evil is necessary, yeah
</p>
<p>
    <br>[Outro]
    <br>And you're still hungry for her
    <br>And you still want her loving
    <br>But she doesn't love you, oh yeah...
</p>
